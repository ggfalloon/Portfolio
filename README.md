# Portfolio

## CSS & Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio
Utilizing the Boostrap CSS Framework, I've created a mobile responsive portfolio. The portfolio provides the user a way to learn more about me, the coding languages in my skill set, discover the projects I've worked on and provide a way to connect with me.


## Usage
URL - https://ggfalloon.github.io/Portfolio/

The "Home" page is complete with an "About Me" section and a listing of the programming languages I'm familiar with. However, I am always eager to learn more.
By clicking on the "Portfolio" link in the navagation bar, you'll see the projects I'm most proud of.
Visit the "Connect" link to request more information.
You'll find direct links to both my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts in the footer of every page. For convenience, the website is responsive and should adapt to any size screen. Thank you for stopping by!
