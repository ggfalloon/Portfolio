# Portfolio

Utilizing the Boostrap CSS Framework, I've created a mobile responsive portfolio. The portfolio provides the user a way learn more about me, my skillset, the projects I've worked on and a way to contact me. This way those who would like to learn more about me or request an interview.

## Usage

The "Home" page is complete with an "About Me" section and a listing of the programming languages I'm familiar with. However, I am always eager to learn more.
By clicking on the "Portfolio" link in the navagation bar, you'll see the projects I'm most proud of.
Visit the "Contact" link in the navagation bar to request more information.
You'll find icon links in the footer to connect with me via GitHub or LinkedIn.
