# Portfolio

## CSS & Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio
Utilizing the Boostrap CSS Framework, I've created a mobile responsive portfolio. The portfolio provides the user a way to learn more about me, the coding languages in my skill set and discover the projects I've recently worked on. It's also a great way to connect with me.


## Usage
URL - https://ggfalloon.github.io/Portfolio/

My portfolio is complete with an "About Me" section and a listing of the programming languages I'm familiar with. However, I am always eager to learn more.
In the "Portfolio" section, you'll see recent projects I'm working on and continually tweaking for optimization and improvement.
Continue scrolling to the "Connect" section to request more information from me via email.
You'll find direct links to both my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts in the footer of every page as well as direct link to email and a downloadable copy of my resume. For convenience, the navigation bar contains links to each section. The website is also responsive and will adapt to any size screen. Thank you for stopping by!
